	# -L -> stands for location, in case the link has redirects

	mkdir -p /run/php
	# The /run/php directory is a temporary filesystem location used by PHP and its associated processes, like PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager), to store runtime data. Hereâ€™s a closer look at its purpose:
	touch /run/php/php7.4-fpm.pid
